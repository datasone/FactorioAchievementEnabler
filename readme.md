# Factorio Achievement Enabler

Built with CMake, VC++ configs might not work. In a hurry? Just grab the latest from [releases](/../../releases) and place it in the same folder as your Factorio.exe (Factorio\bin\x64).

This won't enable achievements on saves where cheats or console commands have been used, it only covers mods. Patches just pulled from IDA.

Updated as of Factorio **1.1.49**. If it doesn't work on the current version, please file an [issue](/../../issues/new) if there isn't one already.
You can include a log by running `path/to/Factorio.exe > path/to/output.log`.
